Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest in Python

This code demonstrates how to use the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection in audio data. Isolation Forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for anomaly detection. It works by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. This process is repeated recursively until all the data points are isolated. The number of splits required to isolate a data point is used as a measure of its anomalousness.
